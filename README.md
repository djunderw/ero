MATLAB function to perform Elementary Row Operations on simplex-tableau matrices

The function performs elementary row operations (EROs) on a matrix, and then
displays the corresponding EROs that were applied.  This may be helpful while
learning the Simplex Method.  When you're going through a bunch of iterations
of the Simplex Method by hand, this function can be used to double-check your
work.
